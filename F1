The F-1, commonly known as Rocketdyne F1, is a rocket engine developed by Rocketdyne. This engine uses a gas-generator cycle developed in the United States in the late 1950s and was used in the Saturn V rocket in the 1960s and early 1970s. Five F-1 engines were used in the S-IC first stage of each Saturn V, which served as the main launch vehicle of the Apollo program. The F-1 remains the most powerful single combustion chamber liquid-propellant rocket engine ever developed.

Every F1 car is composed of two main components − the chassis and the engine.

Chassis − Formula One cars these days are made from carbon fiber and ultra-lightweight components. The weight must be not less than 702 kg or 1548 lbs, including the driver and tires, but excluding the fuel.

The dimensions of a Formula One car must be maximum 180 cm (width) × 95cm (height); there is no specified number for maximum length, but all cars tend to be of almost the same length.

Engine − According to regulation changes in 2014, all F1 cars must deploy 1.6 liter turbocharged V6 engines.

I'm 90% sure that the Flash-ADC I experimented with in the GlueX experiment prototype was called an "F1" chip, but in searching the GlueX documentation, while I can find references to Flash-ADCs, I can't see anything that says F1 anywhere.  I'm going to leave a reference to the experiment anyway, though:

I'm sure there are also references we can put in here about electron orbitals; or would that be 1F, not F1?  Regardless.  Spectroscopic notation doesn't make any sense anyway; no one will notice.
